  <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
  <p>Dear Dr. Smith:<br><br>
Ever since I started teaching at the elementary school level, I have been passionate in my commitment to three things: maximizing individual student performance, inspiring students’ interest in technology and instilling a sense of self-worth among all students. I have dedicated my career to each of these pursuits, as my enclosed resume will attest.<br><br>

That’s why I was excited to see the advertisement on Monster for an elementary teacher in your district. ABC Public Schools has earned a positive reputation for celebrating diversity, achieving academic excellence and using technology as a learning tool. It would be an honor to teach your students and serve a district that maintains high educational standards and provides students with opportunities for personal growth.<br><br>

My qualifications include 12 years of elementary teaching experience, MEd and BS degrees in elementary education, and a current senior professional educator (middle childhood) license in the state of Ohio.<br><br>

In my most recent position as elementary educator for DEF Public School District, I developed and taught 4th and 5th grade curricula. For more than 10 years, I provided effective classroom management, creative lesson plans, detailed student evaluations and highly praised instructional delivery. As an enthusiastic volunteer, I founded and grew the school’s after-school technology club, an innovative program that covered diverse technology areas -- from Internet security best practices to PowerPoint tutorials. The program became so popular that it was the school’s only after-school program that was consistently filled to capacity.<br><br>

Although I enjoyed my tenure at DEF Public School District, my position was eliminated last May following a round of layoffs. I am eager to resume my teaching career and would be delighted to interview for this opportunity. Please feel free to contact me at 216-555-5555 or email winifred@somedomain.com to set up a meeting.<br><br>

Thank you for your interest and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br><br>
